# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

The folders and files inside nvim/ are supposed to be placed into
https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/tree/main/lua/custom

The custom/ folder needs to be manually created

The awesomeWM config is not mine, but I don't remember from who it was.
I only made some small modifications.
